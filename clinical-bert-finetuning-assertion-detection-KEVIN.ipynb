    "This work is based on the paper \"Assertion Detection in Clinical Notes: Medical Language Models to the Rescue?\" , using Language model for assertion detection. Assertion detection is the task to identify the assertion of an entity based on textual cues in unstructured text. In other words we want to classify the assertions made on given medical concepts as being :\n",
    "* present\n",
    "* absent\n",
    "* possible in the patient\n",

dopamine gtt was weaned however he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement a swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated pad and elevated cvp without an obtainable wedge pressure he also had a high co and low svr suggestive of sepsis but he never had an elevated wbc and

liters for the hospital stay he was then transitioned to oral lasix for maintainence the patient had an echo on 2017 09 04 with the results above in detail it was unchanged in comparison to 2017 08 14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis the patient had another echo on 2017 09 14 with no new changes at discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic satting well on room air and without peripheral edema his dry weight is 70 4 kg ischemia the patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to chf exacerbation he was continued on aspirin metoprolol and lipitor with no further issues rhythm the patient is completely pacer dependent being epicardially paced at 70 he is on amiodarone for post op afib and this was continued this entire admission his underlying rhythm is atrial flutter it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted anti coagulation was started with warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2 3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks the patient s inr became supratherapeutic and coumadin was held his coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg his inr continued to flucuate he was discharged on 1 mg but a stable regimen had not been achieved his inr will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable his inr goal is 02 24 2 sob on admission likely due to chf exacerbation with diuresis of over 36 l during his admission he had 4 surgeries 3 cardiac surgeries earlier in the summer so it is likely that he required copious ivf hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload it appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non compliance at rehab per previous discharge summaries on discharge the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as prn nebs and inh copd meds 3 metabolic alkalosis hypochloremia etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and or post hypercapnia this acutely worsened on 2017 09 18 when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an abg revealed a co2 of over 100 likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis the patient was therefore intubated for ventilation and continued to be diuresed his co2 improved and he was extubated after a few days all sedating medications were held and serial abgs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis 4 pleural effusions s p right thoracentesis on 2017 09 06 1600 ml of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space gram stain and cultures were negative cytology was negative the right pleural effusion slowly re accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis repeat cxr showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications 5 t2dm the patient was started on glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale he was monitored with qid fingersticks his blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge 6 hyperlipidemia the patient was continued on his statin 7 copd the patient was continued on nebs 8 ms changes the patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities his mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above neurology was also consulted and a head ct showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status an eeg showed mild encephalopathy but no other findings his mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose he was discharged on this medication 9 hypothyroidism the patient was continued on his outpatient dose of levothyroxine 10 uti the patient was started on levofloxacin at newton wellesley hospital for a question of uti based on u a positive for wbc ucx during this hospitalization were negative and levofloxacin was d c d 11 chronic lower back pain the patient was treated with a lidocaine patch and percocet prn stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and ms changes 12 wound care the patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer wound care was consulted on 2017 09 05 and they made several recommendations for the left gluteal pressure ulcer they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner thin layer of duoderm gel air dry allevyn foam adhesive over the site and change every 2 days or prn for the left chest wound they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser pat dry pack aquacel ag rope and moisten with saline cover with dry gauze and change daily these recommendations were followed throughout the admission 13 voiding pt failed multiple attempts to void on his own case was discussed with neurology he was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission he is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue until then his foley should remain in place 14 code the patient was full code during admission medications on admission

pseudomonal pneumonia both of these etiologies were treated and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings however the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status he was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head ct mri lp and eeg this work up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct likely cardioembolic however they felt this event could not account for his new severe global deficit this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process likely anoxic encephalopathy for which the prognosis is extremely grim this was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient s wife son primary care doctor icu attending and neurology consultant in the presence of a asian interpreter the end result of these discussion was that the patient s wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery the family decided to

history significant for an atrioseptal defect repair at age 18 congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45 and a recent cardiac myocardial infarction pulmonary hypertension and mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation he was seen by his primary care physician the day before admission and complained of two weeks of increasing shortness of breath and fatigue weight gain and abdominal fullness he was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation the patient reported feeling at his baseline with chronic mild dyspnea on exertion until two weeks prior to admission during this period he had also been weaned off of his digoxin starting early in february over the two weeks prior to admission he had noticed an increasing heart rate from his baseline in the 60s to a heart rate in the 120s he had also some increased shortness of breath and a 10 pound weight gain and new three to four pillow orthopnea with a dry cough he denied fevers chills nausea or vomiting

alkaline phosphatase 283 total bilirubin 1 0 amylase 71 glucose tolerance test 317 electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter echocardiogram showed moderate dilated left atrium no atrioseptal defect severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe left ventricular systolic function and moderately dilated right ventricle there was global hypokinesis apical throughout the right ventricle and abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular volume overload moderate to severe 3 mitral regurgitation and 3 tricuspid regurgitation along with moderate pulmonary early systolic hypertension of note this echocardiogram was performed when the patient was tachycardiac hospital course 1 hypotension the patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s upon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted initially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure however subsequent it was determined that the patient s hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure therefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate 2 atrial fibrillation the patient s digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission it was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response the patient was loaded once again with digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of lopressor three times a day in addition the patient was started on verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s 3 congestive heart failure during the initial course of the patient s admission it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted the patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids however subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath chest x rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure the decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient s heart failure in addition plans were made to evaluate the patient s cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy 4 abnormal liver function tests the patient had an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase an ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis however an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease there was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion the patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s it was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use 5 fall the patient had a mechanical fall during his admission he did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued he was walking in the hall dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance he fell backwards landing on his buttocks and bumped his head his neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma a computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage 6 rectal bleeding the patient has a history of rectal bleeding ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer the patient has been treated with argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for

history of diabetes mellitus he has a history of peripheral neuropathy kidney transplantation in 2003 secondary to diabetic nephropathy as well as throat cancer in 2004 treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation mr mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy a cervical mri scan showed very impressive disc herniations at c5 c6 less so at c4 c5 with clear cut cord compression particularly on the right side c5 c6 therefore he was admitted for c4 c5 and c5 c6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion physical examination postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees blood pressure 145 80 pulse 60 respiratory rate 10 100 on a non rebreather he was awake alert uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site the wounds were clean dry and intact and flat hospital course while in the pacu anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his sao2 dropped to 89 his respiratory rate was 30 on face mask interoperatively he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate although requiring some neo synephrine interoperatively he responded to intravenous lasix with 3 2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement the etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume no definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction he was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully he was given lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume he was also put on lopressor 150 mg twice a day also in the intensive care unit o2 saturation was closely monitored the patient became agitated with both tent and bi pap machine although continued to saturate well he was transferred to medicine the morning of 2010 08 30 for continued medical management post surgery on the day of transfer the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium thus a delirium work up was initiated looking for precipitants 1 when his o2 saturation was monitored his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay 2 his non essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued those included temocillin nortriptyline haldol lorazepam venlafaxine bupropion and gabapentin in addition his cyclosporin levels were checked 3 hypo or hyperglycemia mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control finger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated therefore it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory 4 infectious causes were evaluated he was febrile in the intensive care unit to 101 0 f yet chest x ray blood cultures urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources a lumbar puncture was considered although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure 5 mass effect was considered although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality a head and neck ct scan non contrast were ordered though to evaluate for such processes no acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of c2 this was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery 6 trauma was also considered the patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma no loss of consciousness throughout his stay chem 10 was monitored there were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium liver function tests were checked only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1 6 tsh was within normal limits as was b12 and folate rpr evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked the assay was nonreactive an eeg was also considered to rule out non convulsive status epilepticus although again this did not seem to be a likely cause on the evening of the 22nd the patient became acutely agitated threatening to leave and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four point restraints for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital the restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08 31 later in the morning on 08 31 the patient was more oriented and alert and asked to have the restraints removed they were taken off two at a time the patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event intramuscular as well as intravenous haldol were ordered p r n for emergency use should he become acutely agitated haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd each progressive day mr donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09 01 the likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and intensive care unit stay in addition to poly pharmacy other concerns during his stay was his kidney function due to his renal transplant in 2003 his immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay his creatinine remained approximately 2 3 to 2 4 he has a baseline renal insufficiency with this in mind when obtaining a ct scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option while the patient was in restraints gentle hydration was initiated since p o intake was not adequate as for his diabetes mellitus the mahoney team provided updated recommendations each day adjusting for the changing p o intake the only other complaints from mr mackey during his stay were soreness at his operative sites for which he was given p r n tylenol once his delirium had resolved in addition he also complained of difficulty with swallowing necessitating only soft and liquid diet this was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes

cordano was admitted on 2009 08 17 for a replacement of transhepatic biliary drainage catheter at that time cholangiogram confirmed that there was a distal stricture of the common bile duct an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also demonstrated similar findings and it is noted there was nodularity in the common bile duct which is worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma therefore the patient was taken to the operating room on 2009 08 24 for a whipple procedure versus hepaticojejunostomy on exploration of the abdomen revealed significant nodularity of the liver indicating of advanced cirrhosis intraoperative frozen section of the distal and proximal common bile duct in the region nodularity which is identified previously by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and regional lymph nodes were all sent to pathology they were all negative for malignancy and therefore a hepaticojejunostomy was performed cholangiogram on postoperative day number two showed no evidence of leakage at the anastomosis site the patient tolerated the procedure well and he was sent to the floor in stable condition the patient s postoperative course was notable for an elevation in white blood cell count peaking at 30 0 on postoperative day number two he was given unasyn for empiric antibiotic treatment at the time blood urine and bile was sent for culture which were all negative a chest x ray was also negative for any pneumonia postoperatively mr cordano also suffered from low urine output ranges between 25 to 30 cc per hour fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1 suggesting a prerenal etiology the sodium creatinine peaked at 2 0 and the patient was treated with boluses of intravenous fluid and intravenous albumin infusion was also administered he responded well to this regimen and made adequate urine output at the same time the patient also developed distentions of the abdomen consistent with accumulation of ascitic fluid he also had significant lower extremity and scrotum edema on postoperative day number eight the patient s oxygen saturation dropped to 85 on room air and he was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for

descending at the bifurcation involving the diagonal branch 70 stenoses of the left circumflex and oblique marginal artery and 90 stenosis of the posterior descending artery his atrioventricular valve gradient was 27 with an av surface area of 91 review of systems review of systems shows that the patient denies any orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea he has no bleeding or clotting problems

soft nontender nondistended no hepatosplenomegaly and no cva tenderness extremities are warm well perfused no cyanosis clubbing or edema palpable dorsalis pedis pulses no varicosities noted the patient was also noted to be right handed hospital course he was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft once consent and preoperative evaluation was complete he was taken to the operating room please refer to the previously dictated operative note of 2016 12 30 by dr lawrence briefly the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm the procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed the left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery diagonal branch obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending finally a super coronary arch graft was implanted this was a graft cardiopulmonary bypass time was 234 minutes his aorta was cross clamped for 168 minutes he had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for 18 minutes the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit intubated on milrinone levophed and propofol drips the rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach pulmonary the patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five after that the patient had no major problems with his lungs his oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation he was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven after an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion neurologic the major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his propofol drip was discontinued because of his confusion a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres suggestive of more chronic infarcts as well as an area in the left corona radiata adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct this was seen on the cat scan on postoperative day number one 12 31 as the patient became more awake he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it in addition he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia over his postoperative course mr douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy he has 4 to 5 strength in his right hand and arm and about 4 strength in his right leg he is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses in addition mr douglass is given trazodone to help him sleep at night a psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder except for perhaps postoperative delirium cardiovascularly the patient did extremely well following the surgery the levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one milrinone was continued until postoperative day number three at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore he has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean dry and intact at the end of the procedure in addition he has hypertension for which he receives metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia for which he receives nothing at this time pulmonary the patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five he was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air gastrointestinal the patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he has been receiving zantac as an inpatient we will put him back on his nexium in addition over the last couple of days prior to discharge the patient did appear a little bit icteric liver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and alt was 44 ast was 34 alkaline phosphatase was 199 within normal limits total bilirubin was 2 8 amylase was 108 and lipase was 213 a right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis in addition the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level the ideal blood sugar levels for mr douglass in this postoperative period should be less than 140 please stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level hematologic the patient during this admission required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit at the time of discharge mr norman hematocrit is at 40 7 fluids electrolytes and nutrition the patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke once he was coherent enough the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who declared him at first an aspiration risk as mr douglass has improved from his initial stroke he has become more lucid and is less of an aspiration risk on 01 12 one day prior to discharge he was cleared by the swallow team to eat a diet as he wishes he is going out on a cardiac healthy diabetic diet as tolerated with boost supplements infectious disease the patient had positive blood and urine cultures on 01 05 for history of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus which was pan sensitive he was started on oct 25 for this bug on 01 08 the patient s central venous line was discontinued the catheterization tip also grew out serratia on the 16th a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than 100 000 colonies of e coli which was intermittently resistant to ciprofloxacin he was started on bactrim for that please continue mr david montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the e coli in his urine disposition mr douglass is being discharged on 2017 01 13 to a rehabilitation facility in good condition follow up one to two weeks with his primary care physician and two to three weeks with his cardiologist and at one month

of health until four days prior to admission when she had a cholecystectomy her postop course was uneventful until one day prior to admission when she developed abdominal pain she went to an outside hospital emergency room and was reassured and sent home on the day of admission she returned to the outside hospital emergency room where an abdominal ct was performed which showed thickened stomach and free air she was sent to new england sinai hospital rehab center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and possible stent placement she had a successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which showed a bile leak at the duct of luschka a stent was placed successfully after her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography the patient developed jaw clenching biting tongue rigidity and cold chills the patient received ampicillin gentamycin and flagyl empirically as well as narcan to reverse fentanyl because of the tongue injury and tachycardia as well as

was admitted to quincy medical center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for possible stent placement for a bile leak secondary to cholecystectomy performed four days prior to admission she then suffered rigidity with jaw clenching and tongue biting secondary to fentanyl administration and was transferred to the cmed ccu for close observation she did well overnight in the cmed ccu she was started on ampicillin gentamycin and flagyl her liver function tests and amylase and lipase were followed closely on the second hospital day the patient was doing much better and was stable from an airway perspective so she was transferred to the general medical floor 1 gastrointestinal as stated the patient was status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement for a bile leak from the duct of luschka the patient was continued on ampicillin gentamycin and flagyl which had been started at the time of transfer to the cmed ccu she had waxing and waning fevers however her white blood cell count was never really elevated and she did not have a bandemia on the day of transfer to the general medical floor the patient had received clear liquids she did not tolerate this very well her amylase and lipase on the day following the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were elevated amylase was 2304 with lipase being 7116 therefore she was made npo and given aggressive intravenous hydration on the second hospital day on the general medical floor the patient had marked rebound to palpation of her abdomen she was followed closely with serial abdominal examinations her amylase and lipase were trending down however an abdominal ct was obtained which showed only mild pancreatitis there were no intra abdominal fluid collections which required any drainage on the third hospital day the patient s pain was improving and the rebound was decreasing her enzymes continued to trend down she received clear liquids in the evening and tolerated these well on the day of discharge the patient was tolerating a brat diet without significant abdominal pain she had no further rebound she had no temperature spikes in greater then 24 hours at the time of discharge 2 hematology the patient s hematocrit was 34 8 at the time of admission it decreased to 30 in the setting of aggressive hydration it remained stable at the time of discharge and it was 29 5 on the day of discharge 3 fen the patient was aggressively hydrated given that she was npo she required periodic repletion of her potassium her bicarb began to drop and she developed an anion gap acidosis this was most likely secondary to ketoacidosis as she had no dextrose in her intravenous fluids this was added on the evening prior to discharge and on the day of discharge her anion gap acidosis had resolved condition on discharge stable medications on discharge 1 levaquin 500 mg one po q day times seven days 2 protonix 40 mg po q day 3 percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to

hospital for an endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography history of present illness mr eugene is a 67 year old male with a remote history of chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse 30 years ago who is transferred now from rehab hospital of the cape islands hospital for an ercp and work up for a cystic lesion at the head of his pancreas on ct scan shown at the outside hospital the patient presented initially to rehab hospital of the cape islands hospital at the end of december for abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis during this admission two ct scans had shown a question of an enlargement of the head of his pancreas versus early pseudocyst the patient was discharged home early from this admission due to family needs while at home the patient did not do well and could tolerate minimal food intake and lost about 20 pounds in one month on an office visit on 01 14 the patient was found to have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase that evening the patient again developed abdominal pain like his pancreatitis with nausea and vomiting for which he was admitted to the rehab hospital of the cape islands hospital in the emergency department at the rehab hospital of the cape islands hospital the patient was noted to have vomited some heme positive material his complete blood count showed 11 bandemia with a total white count of 10 a hida scan showed no flow question of pancreatitis versus common bile duct obstruction his electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm a chest x ray was unremarkable during his admission to rehab hospital of the cape islands hospital the patient had dropped his hematocrit to the 30 s with recorded melena he received an mrcp which was negative for evidence of stones an ultrasound showed normal gallbladder with no wall thickening but a dilated common bile duct of 8 mm measured on ct scan the patient had an attempted ercp on 01 18 which was unsuccessful due to a long nipple like papilla he was therefore transferred to saints medical center for endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography the patient s blood cultures at outside hospital grew out streptococcus sanguis gordonii on 01 18 this was sensitive to clindamycin erythromycin penicillin s and vancomycin prior to this result the patient had already been on ampicillin sulbactam and gentamycin it appears from the discharge summary that the patient was placed on unasyn 3 grams intravenously every six hours after his ercp past medical history 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus 2 right rotator cuff injury 3 gastroesophageal reflux disease with

swelling neurologic examination revealed an alert and oriented individual his face was symmetric tongue was midline his language was fluent and normal the patient was moving all four extremities with ease there was no formal strength test done laboratory studies revealed a hematocrit of 32 6 white count of 6 0 his platelet count was 267 his mcv was 88 red cell distribution was 13 4 chemistry on admission showed a sodium of 141 potassium of 4 3 chloride of 107 bicarbonate of 25 bun of 4 creatinine of 0 6 and a sugar of 177 liver function tests revealed an alt of 31 ast of 36 alkaline phosphatase of 509 total bilirubin was 0 8 albumin was 2 6 his blood cultures were drawn and pending urinalysis revealed trace glucose no ketones no red cells no white cells and less than one epithelial cells course in hospital the patient was taken down to the endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatogram upon admission on this examination the patient was found to have mild biliary stricture most likely secondary to chronic pancreatitis cytology was obtained he was also found to have dilated pancreatic ducts with calcifications consistent with chronic pancreatitis the patient underwent a percutaneous sphincterotomy extended to a full sphincterectomy he also had successful extraction of stone fragments the patient tolerated this procedure well and had no complications the patient subsequently underwent a ct scan angiogram with pancreas protocol to assess the pseudocyst versus enlarged pancreas head the results of this study indicated that this structure at the head of his pancreas is most likely a forming pseudocyst however the suspicion of malignancy is still possible and the patient underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of this mass on 2011 01 20 the cytology for this biopsy is still pending the patient recovered well status post these two procedures he had no complications and no subsequently pancreatitis his alkaline phosphatase and all the other abnormal liver function tests were resolving he had no pain and did not require any pain medications he was tolerating food very well and was afebrile throughout admission with regards to the patient s documented strep septicemia in the outside hospital the infectious disease team was formally consulted upon obtaining more information from rehab hospital of the cape islands hospital it appears that the patient had two out of four bottles growing out streptococcus sanguis in the outside hospital the patient appeared to have been covered by ampicillin gentamycin and then unasyn in the outside hospital the patient on admission was placed on ampicillin gentamycin and flagyl with repeated blood cultures that were negative the patient was reduced to single mckenzie of intravenous ampicillin for this documented septicemia this patient went for a endocarditis work up he had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed no vegetations on this echocardiogram he was found to have mildly dilated left atrium mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55 there were no other abnormalities noted on this study the patient then underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram on 01 24 on this echocardiogram he was again noted to not have any evidence for valvular vegetations a complex plaque was found in the aortic arch in the descending thoracic aorta although this plaque is non mobile there was focal mitral valve prolapse noted without pathologic mitral regurgitation the patient was noted to have trace aortic regurgitation a panorex x ray of his two teeth were obtained and a dental consultation was done the patient was thought to have normal dental hygiene and low suspicion for a source of his alpha septicemia from his mouth infectious disease department as well as cardiology had recommended a formal 14 day course of intravenous antibiotics to treat a documented alpha streptococcal septicemia from outside hospital blood cultures the patient s insurance company however would not pay for home antibiotics after much discussion with the patient the patient was informed of the risks of not finishing a 14 day course of intravenous antibiotics and chose to go home he had three days of antibiotics remaining at the time of discharge it was discussed with the patient to send him out on augmentin 500 mg three times a day for ten more days he was to follow up with his primary care physician within two to three days for repeat laboratory studies and blood cultures he was to return to the hospital with any signs of

diuresis she denies any cp cough fever abdominal pain diarrhea black or bloody stools or headache her urine output decreased to nearly zero in the setting of her ongoing pericardial effusion she was transferred for closer observation to the ccu the ccu fellow and team declined to do pericardial drainage as the pt was hemodynamically stable without change in appearance of effusion by echo performed at bedside by cards fellow as she was felt by the ccu to be a poor candidate for right heart cath was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 110 s 120 s systolic and pulse 70 s 80 s she was called out of the ccu and back to the cardiac floor without intervention the procedure team was called to consider doing a left thoracentesis but she was declined because it was felt that her

of iv lasix 200 mg then 300 mg iv were given with a good response however she remained net positive fluid balance renal consultants did not feel there was an emergent need for dialysis a nitro drip

declining clinical status the ccu was notified for possible transfer the cmed csru intern called the murphy robert leigh to give her the update with regards to the pt s deteriorating clinical status it was felt that given her age multiple co morbidities that her prognosis was poor even prior to ccu admission possible pericardial drainage or repeat thoracenteses goals of care were clarified with her murphy robert sanchez explained to lewin that pt will likely need to be intubated as she cannot lie flat and most likely cannot undergo pericardial drainage thoracentesis or right heart cath with bipap which would have been the next measure after nrb and prior to intubation explained that despite these invasive measures she still has a very poor prognosis odell stated she had been thinking about this all night of 2018 05 30 and agreed that this is not what the pt would have wanted odell does not believe the pt would want to be intubated with central line right heart cath in the ccu she requested the patient be made comfort measures only she was dnr dni on admission this was documented in the computer confirmed with cardiology attending and fellow and conveyed to the ccu staff who

perforation from pacer however she had a normal echo appearance of lead no tamponade by exam this has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker it was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement although this was not seen on imaging in the last 12 hours of her life her pulsus was 12 and she was felt to likely

stable she is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis mid brain the superior cerebellar areas left thalamus bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery the patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts a chest x ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate initially this improved on clindamycin and cefotetan but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen sputum grew out klebsiella pneumoniae and she was treated with gentamicin and ancef for 14 days intravenous bug being sensitive to these two drugs a left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance and found to be sterile and without evidence of empyema the patient is on ciprofloxacin the day of discharge is day 3 of 7 after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued she has developed bad thrush in this setting she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on nystatin swish and spit five times a day she also gets peridex to clean out her mouth once her liver enzymes are completely normal a seven day course of fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics she has been afebrile for greater than 10 days including several days on oral antibiotics the patient apos s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course to about three times normal especially the sgot and sgpt these have spontaneously reversed and are nearly normal at the time of discharge a right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis the exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear but we are being careful about administering drugs which might irritate the liver the patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization iron studies are all entirely normal her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies the plan is to give her folic acid but not iron the patient apos s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion this is thought due to the extensive course of gentamicin which she received this must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium the patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization this may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process with fluids administered as described she should not have any problems from this her sodiums were never below 130 she does well with tube feeds her tube feeds orders are as follow full strength replete with fiber at 70 cc per hour in addition the patient gets 250 cc of juice not water three times a day she also gets lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds she also gets metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist showed that the patient is aspirating at this time but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon it is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for g tube placement are made at this time she has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up she did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes in the first week of november her electrocardiogram showed t wave inversions in the lateral leads correlating with an

and ataxia she was standing and walking with her friend who quot had to catch her from falling down quot as she toppled towards the right she evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes the following day she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted in the subsequent two days she had several small spells of quot imbalance quot particularly towards the right and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness there was no diplopia visual loss speech abnormality or sensory

carotid non invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations on the second hospital day her gait continued to be markedly unstable although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria she was seen by the psychiatry service she was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment the psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology the patient was evaluated in one

biopsy showed abnormal vasculature hemosiderin deposit leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected the postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention she was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery

acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 2 pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 3 adult respiratory distress syndrome history of present illness mr breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia developed adult respiratory distress syndrome and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support mr breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01 17 91 he was admitted to the retelk county medical center at that time and was treated with bactrim and steroids he was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study he initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of bactrim and a steroid taper at discharge after about two weeks post extubation he had an o2 saturation of approximately 95 on room air he was seen by dr seen and dr seen as an out patient on 02 06 91 he was seen in flfdmc and at that point his temperature was noted to be 101 4 and he had malaise and diarrhea he was evaluated in the emergency room at that time his oxygen saturation was only 90 on room air and his chest x ray showed no change cultures were taken and he was sent out on 02 08 91 the patient called dr seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise he was seen in flfdmc where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway his oxygen saturation at that time was only 86 on room air and he was admitted past medical history 1 hiv positive with a cd4 count of 74 2 recent pcp 3 status post right elbow surgery 4 venereal disease history 5 ppd anergic the patient apos s hiv risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse prostitution and a former prisoner physical examination on presentation the patient was a young appearing hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140 90 heart rate 120 respirations 32 and temperature 101 skin jaundiced heent revealed icteric sclerae the oropharynx with extensive thrush and an ulcer under his tongue neck he had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple lungs had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields cardiac showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs rubs or gallops there was no costovertebral angle tenderness abdomen soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness his liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin his spleen was not palpable rectal he had guaiac positive stools extremities unremarkable genitourinary his penis had a 1 2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge neurological non focal laboratory

bun 21 creatinine 1 2 and glucose 122 alt was 181 ast was 156 ldh was 336 alkaline phosphatase was 214 and bilirubin was 12 7 total on 02 06 his bilirubin had been 7 2 with 6 direct his arterial blood gas on 50 was po2 92 pco2 24 and ph 7 46 his chest x ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates hospital course the patient was admitted for work up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both in terms of pulmonary function it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a bactrim failure for pcp although this was unusual he was started on pentamidine especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to bactrim the patient was also covered with erythromycin and gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods he was given supplemental oxygen in terms of his liver abnormalities it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities titers for cmv and epstein barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent stool was sent for ova and parasites gastrointestinal was consulted initially the patient did well in terms of his pre status and required less oxygen however on 02 10 91 his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased actually in reviewing the records at this point it appears that pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of erythromycin and gentamicin the patient apos s respiratory status worsened and his ldh climbed so he began pentamidine on 02 10 91 on 02 11 91 the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50 facemask but then required more oxygen dropped his o2 saturations and was intubated on 02 11 91 he was transferred to the intensive care unit on 12 12 90 on gentamicin vancomycin pentamidine and prednisone also of note at that point hepatitis c virus serologies had come back positive however at this point his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12 1 and total being 14 1 the patient apos s abdominal ct scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction the patient apos s liver function tests appeared to improve the patient apos s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on acyclovir on 02 13 91 the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted no other cultures grew out and the patient apos s clinical status deteriorated the patient required 100 oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator he required elevated ventilatory pressures with pips often above 60 fortunately no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned however the patient apos s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80 even using reverse i to e ventilation paralysis sedation and other modes of ventilation patient underwent liver biopsy on 02 16 91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died the patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1 75 hematocrit as low as 26 and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02 15 91 these were supported with blood products and hematology was consulted they felt that it was most likely secondary to bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died bone marrow biopsy was not attempted discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis the family decided in consultation with the medical team to withdraw ventilatory support this was done on the evening of 02 18 91 patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6 40 p m disposition the patient died in

biliary drain the drain was replaced over the wire 8 10 by ir when it was accidentally removed increased flow again the patient had signs and symptoms develop of sbp also with an elevated white count he was treated broadly with amp levo and flagyl cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods the patient apos s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells 500 red cells with 82 polyps 11 lymphs 7 monos clinically this was consistent with sbp although unfortunately fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer he underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic this had to be performed by ir because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside he received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on levofloxacin iv for prophylaxis against sbp 2 pulmonary from a pulmonary standpoint he continued to complain of shortness of breath his apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis however with persistent abdomen distention there is likely restrictive deficit and in addition after each tap he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema requiring both albumin and lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids on the day of discharge he is stating approximately 91 to 92 on three to four liters chest xray is still consistent with volume overload the plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and lasix to mobilize his fluid 3 cardiovascular he had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction echocardiogram showed 50 ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation he did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course 4 endocrine diabetes his avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile he is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin 5 heme from a heme standpoint he presented anemic and with an elevated pt inr he required a few transfusions during his hospital course he also required ffp initially to reverse his coagulopathy however this resolved on its own over the hospital course his inr normalized however unfortunately he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on lovenox 6 renal he had a creatinine of 4 0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid currently at 1 7 on discharge from his urinalysis he has mostly a prerenal state however he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state at the time nutrition was following initially with a low fat low cholesterol low sugar diet his appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses therefore we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes 7 id please see gi he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical sbp he will be maintained on levofloxacin for prophylaxis against sbp given that he will need continued taps 8 oncology the patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy however given his rapid clinical decline this was deferred and i do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him his pain here has been controlled initially on oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain as he becomes progressively more somnolent this will likely need to be switched to iv pain medications only discussion at that point in time should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable code status the patient is a dnr dni this is an unfortunate

oaksgekesser memorial hospital emergency room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered do not resuscitate the patient was not intubated however he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics a chest x ray in the oaksgekesser memorial hospital emergency room showed new changes on his chest x ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema with scarring in both lungs there were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe these were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema past medical history

course the patient was stabilized in the medical intensive care unit he stayed in the unit for about one day during that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with albuterol he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1 5l the second day after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu medrol as the patient apos s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved a chest x ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day this was started on 4 2 99 and should be continued for ten days the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia the patient apos s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2 3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal it was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then the patient apos s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with lasix while in the oaksgekesser memorial hospital the patient on 4 4 99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in cimetidine while in the intensive care unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease the patient was upgraded to prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease the patient did have any nausea vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding the patient apos s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to prilosec while in oaksgekesser memorial hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently it is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home they wanted the patient to return to his home

diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in t4 and t8 with no cord compression at that time he was then treated with radiation therapy from t3 to t9 receiving 2500 cgy from 08 94 to 09 94 he has been on decadron since 08 94 about two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs he also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities he stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair an mri without gadolinium done on 11 20 94 of the

started on ms contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the petersly hospital and medical center however one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital the patient apos s right lower extremity became red swollen and increasingly painful he has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased he also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence at the time of presentation the patient denied headache arm weakness changes in vision dysarthria abdominal pain nausea or vomiting chest pain or shortness of breath he

blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew pseudomonas aeruginosa he was treated with ceftazidime gentamicin and vancomycin and also was started on a dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis a swan was placed and initial readings were cvp of 6 wedge pressure of 10 to 12 cardiac index of 4 7 and svr of 438 all consistent with a pseudomonas sepsis picture he was given stress steroids and

positive granular casts chest x ray was without infiltrates wand in good position an mri was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral t9 to t12 area invading the neural foramina there was no csf density these findings were consistent with the cord compression hospital course by problems 1 infectious disease cellulitis the patient apos s clinical situation was most consistent with a pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out pseudomonas that was sensitive to imipenem and tobramycin there were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at retelk county medical center and those also grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa the organism grown at this institution was sensitive to imipenem ceftazidime amikacin gentamicin ciprofloxacin tobramycin but was resistant to cefotetan ceftriaxone mezlocillin bactrim ampicillin chloramphenicol and sulbactam he was treated initially with ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism apos s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital he was subsequently switched to imipenem and tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course the tobramycin and imipenem were started on 11 25 94 in addition the patient received a five day course of intravenous igg to improve infection control vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11 28 94 and this was primarily to provide improved mrsa coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity he was evaluated by the surgery department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention amputation at this time he is being maintained with twice daily xeroform with betadine changes these dressing changes are applied by applying the xeroform on betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages of note the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes the plan is to complete a full course of imipenem and tobramycin for his pseudomonas cellulitis as mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh the cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression 2 cardiovascular the patient was initially treated with dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved he was noted to be in rapid af on several episodes receiving 5 mg iv lopressor each time with improvement he has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm an echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global ef the patient is being maintained on digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation he has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization the plan is to continue the digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better 3 oncology the patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine he has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay the plan is to complete a full course of xrt to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma the patient apos s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied however the mri appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy 4 neurologic as mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids he was initially treated with iv decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h his neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema his decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg iv q6h on 12 3 94 his decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely 5 blood sugars the patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus he has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving nph in the morning and night in addition to a czi sliding scale on a q6h basis the plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high 6 respiratory he initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90 however with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his o2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93 he can be given intravenous lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema 7 nutrition the patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia he has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued he should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained 8 elevated pt and ptt both of these responded to three day course of vitamin k 10 mg each day his pt and ptt are now normal however he continues to run a low platelet count this has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant we have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20 000 to reduce his bleeding risk he also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his hct around 30

      "837898389 6) RESPIRATORY : He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\n",
      "837898389 However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\n",
      "837898389 He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\n",
      "837898389 7) NUTRITION : The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\n",
      "837898389 He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\n",

      "837898389 8) ELEVATED PT and PTT : Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\n",
      "837898389 His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\n",
      "837898389 This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\n",
      "837898389 We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\n",
      "837898389 He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\n",
      "837898389 Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .\n",
