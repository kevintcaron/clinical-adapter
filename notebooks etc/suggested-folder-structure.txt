    /data
      /preprocessed-data - save as npy or npz? (keep private)
    /utils
        /data-utils
        /model-utils

        /adapter-utils
    /experiments - scripts here and outputs for each experiment (maybe don't need scripts here)
        /ner
            /bert - e.g. bert script, bert result
            /clinicalbert
        /ast
            /bert
            /clinicalbert
    /models - output models (might want to seperate models into type)
        /ner
            /bert - e.g. ner bert models
            /clinicalbert
        /ast
            /bert
            /clinicalbert
    /adapters - output adapters
    /configs
    /extra
    main.py - based on configs to run each experiment (load config, run exp)
	    - has base code for running exps, calls other scripts specific to model running
    environment.yaml
    Readme.md

Suggestions:

- Move all exisitng folders to /extra
- To merge PRs only after review
- To use reusabel functions
